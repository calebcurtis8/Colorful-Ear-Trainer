# Colorful Ear Trainer

- [PLAY](https://calebcurtis8.github.io/colorful-ear-trainer/)
- Uses Snowpack, Tailwind, EJS

Based on the ear training principles of Charlie Banacos. Helps develop immediate response to notes in a harmonic context.
## What it does:
1. Plays a cadence in your selected key, tonality, and progression
2. Plays a random note or notes from a limited or unlimited set of notes within a particular octave range.
3. You play the notes you hear into the keyboard.
### You can go simple:
- Which single note within a C major triad is played? You have 5 seconds to answer.
- Which single note within a C major scale is played? You have 4 seconds to answer.
### Or more difficult:
- Which single note within the chromatic scale is played? You have 2 seconds to answer.
### Or more difficult:
- What are the 4 notes within the chromatic scale that are played, with a 3 octave spread? You have 2 seconds per note to answer.
## Design to your heart's content.
As you succeed the game gets more and more colorful, until you make a mistake!
What I love about this approach is that everything you are quizzed on is placed in context, and you are forced to respond quickly. This creates real, applicable, knowledge and heightened awareness when improvising or listening to music.
## Features:
- Global timer - ie. how much can you accomplish in 5 minutes
- Dark Mode
- Random keys
- Streaks and high scores that persist across sessions
- Logic to de-prioritize notes that you get right more often
- Play cadence every X notes - so you can hear the cadence less often
- Minor tonality cadence
- Multiple cadence options
- Octave range selector from octaves 0-7

TODO:
- Levels and a "curriculum" to lead you through parameters that slowly and steadily increase in difficulty
